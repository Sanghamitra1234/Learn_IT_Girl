##IF YOU HAVE A PYTHON VERSION 3.7, YOU WILL GET ERRORS WHILE INSTALLING RASA-CORE.
A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE TO THAT (USING ANACONDA)

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
 ** conda create -n myenv python=3.6

2. ACTIVATE YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
 ** activate myenv

3. INSTALL EVERYTHING FROM REQUIREMENT FILE
 ** pip install -r requirements.txt

4. DOWNLOAD ENGLISH FROM SPACY AS OUR CHATBOT IS GOING TO BE BUILT ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE (in administrative mode)
 ** python -m spacy download en

5. AS THE RASA-NLU Trainer IS IN JS FORM, YOU NEED TO ISTALL NPM, AFTER THAT
 ** npm i -g rasa-nlu-trainer

##AFTER COMPLETE INSTALLATION, MAKE A JSON FILE INSIDE THE DATA FOLDER

1. CREATE GREET AND GOODBYE INTENTS
**(in cmd)AFTER GOING INTO DATA FOLDER, YOU CAN TYPE : **rasa-nlu-trainer  (makes  job easier)

2. AFTER CREATING NLU_MODEL.PY, RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATIVE MODE.
	If , it shows os error , cant download "en"
     ** python -m spacy download en
then RUN 
** python nlu_model.py

##ONLINE AND OFFLINE TRAINING OF DIALOGUE MODELS

1. RUN THE FILE TRAIN_INIT.PY
 ** python train_init.py

2. RUN THE FILE TRAIN_ONLINE.PY
**python train_online.py
