##IF YOU HAVE A PYTHON VERSION 3.7, YOU WILL GET ERRORS WHILE INSTALLING RASA-CORE.
A DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE TO THAT (USING ANACONDA)

1. CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
 ** conda create -n myenv python=3.6

2. ACTIVATE YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
 ** activate myenv

3. INSTALL EVERYTHING FROM REQUIREMENT FILE
 ** pip install -r requirements.txt

4. DOWNLOAD ENGLISH FROM SPACY AS OUR CHATBOT IS GOING TO BE BUILT ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE
 ** python -m spacy download en

5. AS THE RASA-NLU Trainer IS IN JS FORM, YOU NEED TO ISTALL NPM, AFTER THAT
 ** npm i -g rasa-nlu-trainer
